# Formation Media React Solution Overview
This project was completed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, React + Express, Nodejs). React is my favourite for front-end development due to its easy of use, great Docs and its popularity.I have prior experience with MongoDB and from a database perspective MongoDB seems the most reasonable as it is originally quite lightweight and for an application that seems likely to require scalability (the use of docker reinforces this) it more effective than say SQLITE. Additionally, MERN is MVC which from my experience is industry standard.
